Walkthrough for Adventure Text Game

Adventure is a text-based game, in which the player controls a character by typing commands. The character will move to different areas and act according to the commands. Text is displayed after each command describing the character's location and state.
I completed this project as final assignment for the course Programming 1 (CS-A1110). 

You are in a castle, and your aim is to go enjoy the view from the balcony. To do that, you need to find the key and unlock the door to get to the balcony, so you need to move through the rooms of the castle. To exit one room, you must collect the item stored in the room first. The game ends with your victory once you get to the balcony.
These are the inputs to win the game directly. 

-	get flashlight
-	go bedroom
-	get key
-	use flashlight
-	go courtyard
-	go tower
-	get glass of water
-	use key
-	go balcony

However, that is not how you are supposed to play. The idea is for the player to wander through the castle, collect the objects they find, and use them when they want/need. 
Using each object has different consequences:
-	the key serves to unlock the balcony door
-	the pair of dancing shoes plays music
-	the hand lens shows the dust in the library
-	the flashlight lights the way when the ghost turns off the room’s lights

To use the “glass of water” object, you can type the command “drink” (“use glass of water” works as well, though).
If you use an object where you do not need it, cannot use it (only in the case of the key), or when you have not collected it yet, a specific message gets printed out. 
The ghost is also wandering through the castle at the same time. If it ends up in the same room as you are, it prints out a message to scare you and a spooky melody is played. Play with audio on (there’s music also in the ballroom)!
Finally, I recommend typing in help to start, to get an overview of the actions. Refer to the same command to check the exact names of the objects (e.g. pair of dancing shoes, glass of water). Overall, follow the hints and instructions printed out at each turn. 


Other information
The Sannazzaro castle actually exists, and it is situated in my home village in northern Italy:  Giarole. The Sannazzaro family still owns the castle and lives there, which makes it a rarity today. You might already be familiar with the castle if you have ever stumbled across @thecastlediary on social media.
All the information contained in the welcome message is accurate (ghost included ;) ), and I used the castle’s official website as my source, which I linked below.
